The purpose is not to re-invent the wheel but rather package existing software and fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\n## Flexibility\r\nIn the light of developments in the Big Data analysis techniques it is crucial for a framework to be adaptive. This includes but is not limited to data formats (both input and output), analysis techniques, job submission.\r\n\r\n## Current candidates for Analysis objects\r\n### Physics eXtension Library - PXL\r\nThe PXL (http://vispa.physik.rwth-aachen.de/pxl)\r\n\r\n### GNU Scientific Library - GSL\r\nExtensive list of features: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/\r\n\r\n### ROOT\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n## Usability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
